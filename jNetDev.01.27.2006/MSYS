This file will explain how to install a MingW/MSys development
system on your Windows machine, similar to the one used to develop
jNetDev.

STEP 1
Open a browser and to go the MingW home page:

	www.mingw.org

From the menu on the left, click on Download. Scrolling down the
page you will see a table with many links to software. Skip over
thte Candidate section to the Current section. Locate the rows with
MSYS in the second column. Then, download and run the file

	MSYS-1.0.10.exe

The version may differ, but you want the .exe from this section.
This is a windows installable and will install a basic MSYS system
for you in C:\Msys

STEP 2
From the same download page, download the MinGW Runtime. This will
be a tar file. Avoid the one with '-src' in its name, as then 
constains the full source code, and we do not need to go that far.

Create the directory C:\MinGW and extract the runtime into it.
ALSO, from the MSYS shell, edit /etc/fstab and add the line:

	C:\mingw	/mingw

to make mingw visible to MSYS.

STEP 3
From the same download page, download the following files:
	MinGW utilities (avoid the -src file)
	GCC ... the gcc-core* file (avoid the -src file)
	GCC ... the gcc-g++* file (avoid the -src file)
	binutils ... the file without -src, -into-html or -build)
	Windows APL ... the win32api file without -src in its name

Extract EACH of these files to the c:\MinGW directory.

STEP 4
Now, send your browser to:

	www.winpcap.org

and select 'Downloads' from the menu at the left. Download and
execute the WinPcap auto-installer to install the DLLs.

STEP 5
Again ... from winpcap.org ... download the Developer's pack and
extract it to a new, empty directory. Then, from the MSYS shell,

	# cd to the WpdPack directory created when you extracted
	# the Developer's Pack
	mkdir /mingw/include/pcap
	cp Include/* /mingw/include/pcap
	cp Lib/* /mingw/lib

FINALLY!!  You are all set to build the jNetDev distribution. See
the file INSTALL.win32 in the root of the distribution tree.
