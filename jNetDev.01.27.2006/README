The purpose of jNetDev is to provide a coherent, object-oriented class
library for reading packets from network devices (NICs) and injecting
packets into the network via those devices. Reading is done via the
well known package pcap (WinPcap on Windows systems). This package may
be found at:
	linux/osx	www.tcpdump.org
	win32		www.winpcap.org

As the above list implies, jNetDev has been ported to linux, osx, and
win32 platforms. For details on how to install on any of these, read
the appropriate INSTALL file (INSTALL.linux, INSTALL.osx or INSTALL.win32).

If you wish only the binaries, and do not wish to recompile jNetDev for
your site, that also may be accomplished using the filed in the bin
directory. See the appropriate BINARIES file for details (BINARIES.linux,
BINARIES.osx or BINARIES.win32).
