<font size="+2"><B>jNetDev - an open source class library for low level packet manipulation in Java</B></font>
<br>
Version 10-14-2005</B></center>
<p>
This package is a class library written in Java that
provides the user with classes to model a number of 
objects important to network programming. Among these
are NICs, IPv4 addresses, Ethernet addresses, packet
captures, packet injection, and a collection of header
formats.
<br><br>
This software is available for in win32/mingw, 
linux, and os/x operating system environments.
<br><br>
The most elementary class is the jND_NIC class, which
models a NIC. NICs are numbered from 0..N-1 where there
are N NICs present in the host. One can find out the
value of N by calling jND_NIC.numberOfNICs(). This is
a static method, so one need not instantiate a jND_NIC object
to call it.
<br><br>
One may instantiate any of the NICs via new jND_NIC(i)
where 'i' is the NIC's number. Once the NIC has been so
instantiated, you may retrieve its system name, its 
description, it's IP address, MAC address, gateway or netmask.
See the documentation for jND_NIC for details.
<br><br>
After NICs come IPv4Addresses and EthernetAddresses. These
classes simply wrap an address in an object to provide
a number of useful methods. These addresses may be constructed
from strings or byte arrays or ints. There are also methods to 
return strings or byte arrays or ints. For details, see jND_IPv4Address
and jND_EthernetAddress.
<br><br>
Next in importance are CaptureSessions. A jND_CaptureSession is
started to listen for incoming packets. One instantiated,
you may set a filter for the capture session and start the
session. When started, a separate thread runs capturing
packets and placing them in a packet queue. When the capture
session is stopped, the thread is killed. See jND_CaptureSession
for details.
<br><br>
Also important is the ability to inject packets into the
network (i.e., write packets). This is done via a jND_NIC. First
the NIC must be opened via the open method of jND_NIC. Then,
the inject method will allow any byte array to be injected.
When done, the close method releases the NIC.
<br><br>
In addition, there are other useful classes, including:
<br><br>
<LI>jND_Mutex for synchronizing thread access to shared resources.</LI>
<LI>jND_Utility which provides a collection of useful utilities.</LI>

Finally, there is a collection of classes to model headers. This is
a growing and changing list, but includes:
<LI>jND_EthernetII and jND_Ethernet802_3 which model the frame headers for
most ethernet frames.</LI>
<LI>jND_ARP which models an ARP header.</LI>
<LI>jND_IPv4 which models an IP (v4) header.</LI>
<LI>jND_ICMP, jND_TCP and jND_UDP which model transport layer headers.</LI>
